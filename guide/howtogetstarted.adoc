In the following chapters you can see which elements and what type of information that is supported in PUF. In some cases you will also get longer snippets
of code and implementation guidelines in order how to properly provide the data. There is also a section with test files that can be useful when implementing PUF.

If your ERP already can create Invoices and Credit notes in https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1.html[Universal Business Language Version 2.1 (UBL 2.1)] or if your ERP can create a UBL based format or CIUS such as http://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/[PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0]
you can easily use this as stepping stone when moving towards PUF.

*Moving from http://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/[PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0] or other UBL based CIUS/Format to Pagero Universal format*

1. Download Pagero Universal Format <<_xml_schemas>>
2. Change namespaces (see chapter <<_namespaces>>)
3. Verify that your interpretation of the UBL elements mentioned in this specification are the same.
4. Change the Customization Id and Profile Id (see chapter <<_customization_and_profile_id>>)
5. If elements from extensions is needed see chapter <<_working_with_extensions>> how this is implemented.
6. Before implementing additional fields available in PUF, validate the document with the XSD schema downloaded in step 1.

NOTE: In the xml schemas provided in chapter <<_xml_schemas>> you will see the structure and the occurrences of every element available in Pagero Universal Format.
This specification will not include any cardinality from a schema perspective nor from what is required in a specific legal domain since this might differ depending
on which specific country, region or business requirements you will have to comply with. In order to know what information is sufficient to provide you should first check what the
requirements from a legal and business perspective and then refer to this specification on where to provide this information. Also notice that the elements and their sort order provided in specification
is done with the Invoice document type. When using CreditNote please xsd provided for possible differencies in element names or sort order.
